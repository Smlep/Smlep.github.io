New features
------------
Many updates have been added since my last [post][post].

The most important one is that it now supports **English**, but here is some other new features added:

- ```--help``` is now supported.
- Exit status now matches the script's result.
- Many error cases are now tested before checking the file.
- Tabs, carriage returns, decimal numbers, and quotes are now handled.

What's next
-----------
I still have a few rules to handle, but the checker is mostly done.

If there is a language that you want to see supported, feel free to open a new [issue][issue-list]. You can see all current issues [here][issue-list].

Here is the project [link][project], check the [README][readme] and the [issues][issue-list] frequently to see which languages are supported!
